# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Set up the Python virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [x] Game purpose: a Streamlit number-guessing game where the player finds a secret number within limited attempts
- [x] Bugs found: directions from hints were wrong, guess/secret comparison issues, logic split across files
- [x] Fixes applied: corrected guess comparison/hints, moved core logic to `logic_utils.py`, added pytest tests
